Written against v0.4.2.

A form shared by several sites can have a different title, email and storage choice on each. Add a row for each site that differs; a site without a row uses the form's own settings.

## Add a site's row

1. Open the form's settings in the Control Panel.
2. Under **Site overrides** in the **Sites** section, choose **Add site override**.
3. Pick the **Site**, and set any of **Title**, **Store Submissions** (**Store** or **Don't store**) and **Email**. Leave a setting empty to keep the form's own.
4. Save.

The site must be one the form is assigned to, and each site can have one row; saving refuses anything else.

The form file carries the row:

```yaml
# resources/forms/contact.yaml
title: Contact
store: true
email:
  -
    to: info@example.com
    subject: 'Website inquiry'
    html: emails/contact
sites:
  - en
  - es
site_overrides:
  -
    site: es
    title: Contacto
    store: false
    email:
      -
        to: info-es@example.com
        subject: 'Consulta del sitio'
        html: emails/contact
```

A row saved in the Control Panel also carries an `id` on the row and on each email, which the Control Panel uses to track them, and writes `store` as the text `'true'` or `'false'`. Leave both as they are: the add-on reads `'false'` the same as `false`, and a row written by hand needs no `id`.

## What each site then does

With the file above:

- A submission from the Spanish site is emailed to `info-es@example.com` only, with the subject `Consulta del sitio`, and is not stored.
- A submission from the English site is emailed to `info@example.com` and stored.

**Note:** a row's email list replaces the form's list on that site rather than adding to it. To keep sending to the form's recipients from that site, list them in the row too.

## Show the site's title

An email template sees the form with its site's values, so `{{ form:title }}` gives the site's title. In `resources/views/emails/contact.antlers.html`, the view both email lists above name:

```antlers
<p>A new message from the {{ form:title }} form.</p>
```

The Spanish site's email reads `A new message from the Contacto form.`; the English site's reads `A new message from the Contact form.`
