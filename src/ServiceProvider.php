/**
 * Service provider for the Multisite Forms add-on.
 *
 * The host application discovers it through `extra.laravel.providers` in
 * `composer.json`. It registers the Control Panel build, the Sites section of
 * the form settings screen, the site rules on form and submission access in
 * the Control Panel and on its form fields editor, that editor's breadcrumb, the
 * blueprints index and the command palette, the site filter on the REST and
 * GraphQL form listings, the gate on core's form submit route, the listener that
 * records a submission's site, and the one that assigns a new form to its
 * creator's sites. Its actions, such as the Duplicate
 * action that replaces core's, are registered from `src/Actions` by Statamic;
 * the rest is added as the phases in the add-on's specification land.
