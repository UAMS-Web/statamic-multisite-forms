/**
 * Records a site on a form's unattributed submissions (#81).
 *
 * A submission saved before the add-on recorded `_site`, or one saved outside the
 * submit route, has no site, and the Control Panel shows it only to a user who can
 * access every site its form is assigned to (#40). This command backfills such
 * submissions with one site, so editors of that site see them. A submission whose
 * file holds an empty `_site` is repaired the same way (#140). Submissions that
 * already record a site are left as they are.
 *
 * It reads through the submission query builder, so it works on whichever driver
 * stores submissions, and saves quietly, as core's own data migrations do: a
 * backfill is not a new submission, so no submission event or its listeners
 * should fire for it. No email is sent either way: core sends a form's email only
 * from its submit route. Each change is logged at `info` level with the
 * submission's id.
 *
 * @command  php please multisite-forms:attribute contact en --dry-run
