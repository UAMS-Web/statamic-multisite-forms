 * Keeps forms the user may not open out of the form fields editor's

 *
 * Core's `FormBlueprintController::edit()` pushes a breadcrumb linking every
 * other form's fields editor, each by title, and Statamic shares the pushed
 * breadcrumbs with the page as `additionalBreadcrumbs`. A user allowed on one
 * form's editor would see the titles of forms assigned to sites they cannot
 * access.
 *
 * Route middleware sees the response only once it is rendered, so this listens
 * for the response being prepared, when the editor's page is still an Inertia
 * response, and replaces the shared breadcrumbs on it with a copy whose links
 * leave out every form whose editor the user may not open. That is the add-on's
 * rule for changing a form, so a link the user sees is one the editor accepts
 * (#116). Core's controller is untouched, and every other response passes
 * through.
