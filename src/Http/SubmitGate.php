/**
 * Attaches the submit gate to core's front-end routes.
 *
 * Core loads its front-end routes, the form submit route among them, under the
 * middleware named by `statamic.routes.middleware` (`web` by default). The gate
 * is appended to each of those that is a middleware group, so it travels with
 * the route whether or not routes are cached. It is listed after
 * `SubstituteBindings` in the priority list, so it runs after binding even if
 * something places it earlier in the group; where a host's priority list leaves
 * `SubstituteBindings` out, it lands last in that list and its place in the
 * group decides, which is after the group's own `SubstituteBindings`.
 *
 * A group the HTTP kernel owns is changed through the kernel. The kernel's
 * group, priority and alias setters each copy the kernel's groups and priority
 * onto the router, replacing the router's; so the router's current groups and
 * priority are copied into the kernel first. Middleware other code pushed onto
 * the router alone is then kept, and a later kernel setter keeps the gate.
