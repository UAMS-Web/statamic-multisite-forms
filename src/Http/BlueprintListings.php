/**
 * Keeps forms the user may not open out of the blueprints index and the
 * command palette (#133).
 *
 * Core's blueprints index lists every form's blueprint, with its title and a
 * link to its fields editor, in the page's `forms` prop
 * (`BlueprintController::forms()`), and the command palette lists every form's
 * blueprint by name with the same link (`Palette::buildFields()`). A user
 * allowed there would see the forms assigned to sites they cannot access.
 *
 * As with the editor's breadcrumb (#124), this listens for the response being
 * prepared, when the index is still an Inertia response and the palette still the
 * collection core's controller returned, and leaves out every form whose editor
 * the user may not open. A listener cannot replace the response, so the palette
 * is filtered in place; with a cache store that keeps objects rather than
 * serializing them, such as the array store, that is the cached palette too,
 * which then stays filtered for that user until core clears the cache. Core's
 * controllers are untouched, and every other response passes through.
