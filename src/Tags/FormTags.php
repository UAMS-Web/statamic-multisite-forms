/**
 * Core's `{{ form }}` tags, gated by site assignment.
 *
 * It registers under core's own handle, `form`, so it replaces core's tags. Each
 * tag that reads a form resolves it for the page's site first: an assigned form,
 * or one with no sites, renders as core renders it, through the site's read-only
 * view; an unassigned form follows the `not_assigned` setting.
 *
 * Seeding core's `form-{handle}` Blink key with the site's view (the spec's first
 * mechanism) is not enough on its own: core puts a form passed in from context
 * straight into that key, replacing a seed, and a missing form makes core throw
 * rather than render nothing. So the form is resolved here, from the base form
 * core finds, every time a tag asks for it.
 *
 * `form:fields` is not gated: core's reads only the fields `form:create` hands
 * it, so it renders nothing once `form:create` is gated.
 *
 * Each tag returns whatever core's returns, which is wider than core's docblocks
 * say (`create` returns an array when there is no parser to render its content,
 * as through `Statamic::tag()`), hence `mixed`. For an unassigned form `create`
 * returns an empty string, or an empty array when there is no parser (#89),
 * `errors` and `success` return `false`, `submission`
 * returns null, and `submissions` returns an empty list, which a tag pair renders
 * as it renders a form with no submissions.
