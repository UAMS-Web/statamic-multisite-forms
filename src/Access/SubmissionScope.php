/**
 * Scopes the submissions a Control Panel user reads to the sites they can access (#78).
 *
 * The scope decorates whichever builder is bound to core's submission query
 * contract, core's Stache builder or a driver's, through `app()->extend()`, so
 * the listing, detail view, delete, export and the forms index count are scoped
 * without replacing a controller or a builder class (#49). It applies only on a
 * Control Panel request by a signed-in user who is not a super user; the API, the
 * `{{ form:submissions }}` tag and console commands read every submission.
 *
 * A submission is kept when its `_site` is a site the user can access. One with no
 * `_site` is kept only when the user can access every site its form is assigned
 * to, or every site for a form with no sites (#40).
 *
 * The unattributed rule depends on the form, and core's Stache builder treats a
 * `form` condition as a restriction on the whole query, not as a condition that
 * can sit inside a nested group, so the scope never puts `form` in a group. When
 * the user covers some forms but not others, it reads the ids of the unattributed
 * submissions of the covered forms with a top-level query, and keeps those ids.
 * Those reads are made once per request and user, not once per builder (#123).
 *
 * Deleting a form deletes its submissions through the same builder, so between
 * core's `FormDeleting` and `FormDeleted` events the request reads unscoped; a
 * form deleted from the Control Panel otherwise left behind the submissions its
 * deleter could not see, and they came back with a new form of the same handle.
