 * Refuses a sites selection that would leave the form outside its saver's edit (#118).
 *
 * Editing a form needs every site it lists, or every configured site for a global
 * form (#77), so a non-super user may not save a site they cannot access, nor an
 * empty selection, which makes the form global, unless they can access every
 * site. A super user, and a save with no signed-in user, pass. A handle naming no
 * configured site is left to `ConfiguredSites`.
 *
 * The rule is implicit, so it also runs when the selection is missing, which
 * saves the form as global just as an empty one does.
