/**
 * Denies Control Panel users the forms of sites they cannot access (#77).
 *
 * Registered as a global `Gate::before()` callback, because core's form and
 * submission policies return true from their own `before()` for any user with
 * `configure forms`, and a policy method would never be reached for them. Only a
 * super user passes untouched; `configure forms` does not bypass the site rules.
 *
 * Two rules apply to an ability asked about a form, or about a submission of one:
 *
 * - A form listing sites is denied to a user who can access none of them.
 * - Changing a form (`edit`, `delete`, `configure form fields`) needs access to
 *   every site it is assigned to, or to every configured site for a global form,
 *   because the change reaches each of those sites.
 *
 * Otherwise the callback returns null, so core's policies decide as before. It
 * never grants anything.
