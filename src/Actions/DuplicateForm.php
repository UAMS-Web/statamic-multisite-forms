 * Core's Duplicate form action, refused for a form the user cannot view (#117).
 *
 * Core's action asks only `create` on the form class and never names the form it
 * copies, so the site rules on form access (#77) could not reach it: a user with
 * `configure forms` could copy a form of a site they cannot access, with its email
 * recipients, data and blueprint. This class also asks `view` on the form, which
 * the add-on's gate answers.
 *
 * Statamic registers every action under the add-on's `src/Actions` by its handle
 * while booting the add-on, after core has registered its own. The short class
 * name matches core's, so this class takes core's handle, `duplicate_form`, and
 * replaces it for running the action and for listing it; the Control Panel posts
 * the same handle as before.
