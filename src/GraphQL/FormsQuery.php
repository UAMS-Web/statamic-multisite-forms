 * no sites, which belong to every site. Without the argument, or with it null, the
 * query is core's. A `site` that names no configured site fails validation, so a
 * typo answers an error rather than an empty list.
 *

 * this subclass in place of core's adds the argument without changing the schema
 * Statamic registers.
