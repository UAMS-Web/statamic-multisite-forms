/**
 * Records the site a submission was made from, under the reserved `_site` key.

 * It listens to `FormSubmitted`, which core dispatches from its submit route
 * after building the submission's data and before saving it or queuing its
 * emails. The site is the one core passes to the email job, from the shared
 * submit-site helper. A visitor cannot put a value of their own in the request
 * body: core treats request values starting with `_` as parameters, and only
 * blueprint fields become data. The site itself comes from the referrer, as
 * core's email site does, and the submit gate admits only the form's sites.
 *
 * Core dispatches `FormSubmitted` halting on the first listener that returns
 * anything other than null, so a listener registered before this one can stop
 * it from running. `SubmissionCreating` is the backstop: on the submit route, a
 * new submission of the submitted form that reaches its first save without
 * `_site` gets it then. A submission saved any other way, including another
 * form's saved during the submit request, is left unattributed, as the spec
 * defines.
