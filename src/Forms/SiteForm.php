 * A read-only view of a form as one site sees it.
 *
 * It holds a copy of the base form's state, so the handle, the blueprint, the
 * action URL and the submissions folder are the base form's, and it remembers
 * the site it was resolved for. Saving or deleting it throws: a resolved view
 * written back would put one site's values into the base file for every site.
 * Build one with `FormResolver`, not directly.
 *
 * The view is always a core Form, whatever class the form contract is bound to,
 * so a driver's own methods (`statamic/eloquent-driver`'s `model()`, for one)
 * are not on it. Reach them through `base()`, which returns the stored form in
 * its own class (#107).
